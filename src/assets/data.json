After a complete redesign and shift in priorities, I was tasked with building out their new website from the ground up, with the help of an awesome backend partner. My role was that of sole front-end developer and one half of the backend team. This was my first foray into Python, Django, and GraphQL. I learned a ton along the way, through trial by fire. I built out models, created custom endpoints for complex requests and wrote GraphQL queries. I also built out the entire front-end and made the data flow throughout it. For e-commerce functionality, Samson struck up a partnership with Direct Commerce Platform. DCP provided all e-commerce related product information and a cart, which I integrated into the site.</p>"
